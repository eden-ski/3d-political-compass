        <p id="text">The Political Compass is a website which uses responses to a
          set of 62 propositions to rate political ideology in a political
          spectrum with two axes: economic and social. Here, I propose an
          alternate model: a political compass with three axes. My primary
          reasoning behind this decision is that a two axis model fails to
          account for foreign policy. By taking
          the redesigned test and selecting how much you agree with each
          statement, I can model your political ideology in three dimensions.
          After finishing the quiz, you will be directed to a results page where
          your political views will be broken down and explained in greater
          detail.</p>
          <p id="text">And remember, please don't overthink the questions. The
            test is most accurate if you answer the first opinion that comes to
            mind.</p>
