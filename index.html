        <p id="text">Political spectrum tests are a common method to model
          a person's political ideology, where results are graphed on geometric 
          axes that represent independent political dimensions. A traditional 
          political spectrum test scores the test taker's political ideology 
          on a one-axis graph, where negative, left scores correlate with 
          liberal beliefs and positive, right scores correlate with 
          conservative beliefs.</p>
        <p id="text">
          A popular criticism of the one-axis spectrum test is that it fails 
          to account for polarized social and economic beliefs. A perfect 
          example are libertarians, who hold socially liberal but 
          economically conservative views. In scoring a one-axis test, these 
          beliefs would cancel out and a libertarian would be labeled a 
          centrist.</p>
        <p id="text">
          The same centrist result can be attained by Stalinists. As 
          Stalinists are economically liberal and socially authoritarian, 
          their contrasting viewpoints converge towards the center of 
          the spectrum. To differentiate between such "centrists," a second 
          axis was added to the graph and the Political Compass was 
          born.</p>
        <p id="text">
          The Political Compass is a website which uses responses to a
          set of 62 propositions to rate political ideology in a political
          spectrum with two axes: economic and social. The addition of a
          second axis allows us to see Milton Friedman for what he really
          is: a libertarian capitalist. Conversely, Joseph Stalin is now 
          accurately depicted as an authoritarian leftist.</p>
        <p id="text">While the addition of a second axis alleviates labeling 
          restrictions imposed by a one-axis compass, it does not exist without 
          its own set of inaccuracies. An important note is that the Political 
          Compass combines domestic policy and foreign policy into the same 
          vertical social axis. This glosses over nuances within the 
          libertarian-authoritarian axis. Some politicians, for 
          instance, are anti-war but socially restrictive on issues like gay 
          marriage (non-interventionist authoritarians) while others are 
          pro-war but in favor of marriage equality (interventionist 
          libertarians). This is hidden on a single social axis.</p>

            The Three-Axis Political Compass</a> 
          by Lew Blank, I was convinced that the Political Compass was in 
          need of an upgrade. Here, I propose an alternate model: a 
          political compass with three axes. My primary
          reasoning behind this decision is that a two axis model fails to
          account for polarized social beliefs in regards to domestic and
          foriegn policy. By taking the redesigned test and selecting 
          how much you agree with each statement, I can model your political 
          ideology in three dimensions. After finishing the quiz, you will be 
          directed to a results page where your political views will be broken 
          down and explained in greater detail.</p>
          <p id="text">And remember, please don't overthink the questions. The
            test is most accurate if you answer the first opinion that comes to
            mind.</p>
